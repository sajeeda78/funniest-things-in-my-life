  <h1>Funniest Moments of My Life</h1>

  <h2>At Home</h2>
  <p>Once I spilled water and blamed it on the cat — only to realize it was juice and we don’t have a cat.</p>

  <h2>At School</h2>
  <p>I stood up to answer a question confidently… only to realize it was for another subject.</p>

  <h2>With Friends</h2>
  <p>We all wore similar outfits by accident and told people we were a pop band named “The Mistakes.”</p>
